#### Update `remark-parse` to v8 ([#8140](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/8140) by [@saramarcondes](https://github.com/saramarcondes), [@fisker](https://github.com/fisker), [@thorn0](https://github.com/thorn0))

[remark](https://remark.js.org/), the Markdown parser that Prettier uses, got a long-overdue update (5.0.0 â†’ 8.0.2, see [remark's changelog](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/releases)). This fixed tons of old bugs, in particular related to parsing list items indented with tabs.

Please note that the new version is stricter in parsing footnotes, a syntax extension not defined in any specification. Previously, Prettier would parse (and output, depending on the `--tab-width` option) multiline footnotes indented with any number of spaces. The new version recognizes only multiline footnotes indented with 4 spaces. This change isn't considered breaking as the syntax is non-standard, but if you happen to use it, before updating Prettier, you might want to use its older version with `--tab-width=4` to make footnotes in your files compatible with the new version.
